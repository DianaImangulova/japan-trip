      <p>
        The origins of Sensō-ji are uncertain. According to legends found in
        sources such as the "Sensō Engi", the temple began in the Asuka period
        when the brothers Hinokuma Hamanari and Takenari discovered a statue of
        Kannon while fishing in the Sumida River in 628. The headman of their
        village, Haji no Nakatomo became a monk and converted his home into a
        temple.
